# Artificial-intelligence-Project
Thoroughly analyzed data provided by Professor Zhao And found the mean, median, variance, and standard deviation using Python. 
Also, I made predictions, built models, and tested them. 
I used Python programming language, Jupyter to work on the project on the local machine (my computer) and migrated to TensorFlow so that I could display my work online through Colab (as can be seen on my GitHub repo).
